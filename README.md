Kitten Tracker Plugin for RuneLite
A simple and convenient plugin for Old School RuneScape that helps you keep track of your pet kitten's needs, ensuring it grows into a healthy cat without running away.

Description
This plugin adds a customizable overlay to your screen that displays timers for your kitten's growth, hunger, and attention levels. The timers are based on the most accurate information available on the OSRS Wiki, ensuring you know exactly when to care for your kitten. The plugin also saves your kitten's progress, so you can pick it up or log out without losing track of its needs.

Features
Live Timers: An overlay tracks the time remaining for:

Growth: The 3-hour journey to becoming a cat.

Hunger: The 30-minute countdown until your kitten gets hungry.

Attention: A dynamic timer that adjusts based on how you interact with your kitten (39 minutes for stroking, 65 minutes for a ball of wool).

Persistent State: Timers are automatically paused and saved when you pick up your kitten, log out, or close the client. They will resume exactly where they left off when your kitten starts following you again.

Desktop Notifications: Receive optional desktop notifications when your kitten is about to run away due to hunger or loneliness, even if RuneLite is not your active window.

Highly Customizable:

Move the overlay to any corner of the screen.

Customize the colors for all timers to match your interface.

Easy Reset: A "Reset Timers" button in the settings panel allows you to easily start fresh when you get a new kitten.
